- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

This was my Second Project Using Tailwind, But I could say that I've learned alot , The fact That tailwind is bulit using Utility-First Structure is what makes it very customizable and simple, although the Calss names would be like this

```html
<main
  class="rounded-3xl drop-shadow-xl lg:w-1/2 bg-white flex flex-col lg:flex-row lg:relative lg:top-1/2 lg:left-1/2 lg:translate-y-1/2 lg:-translate-x-1/2"
>
  <section
    class="z-10 shadow-2xl lg:shadow-xl lg:shadow-[var(--gradient-lightRoyalBlue-lowerOpacity)] lg:hover:shadow-xl lg:hover:shadow-[var(--gradient-lightSlateBlue)] shadow-[var(--gradient-lightRoyalBlue-lowerOpacity)] rounded-xl lg:rounded-3xl flex-1 basis-1/2 left items-center py-7 px-12 text-white flex flex-col text-center gap-4"
  ></section>
</main>
```
